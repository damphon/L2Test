#FIXES TO IMPLEMENT FOR BETA BUILD
#Add config page with the following values for leads to change
###How long techs have to enter their UID
###How long techs have to take the test
###Change what percentage constitutes a passing score (change the color shown for grades)
###Text feild leads can use for L2 Test explanation on front page.
###How many questions are on the test.
#Stop techs from being able to refresh for a different test.
#1 button backups of all important data
#Change from 8 answeres to any number of answeres
##Change all Database feilds to be more human readable for CSV backups
##Allow leads to add images to test 
##Make CSV import without the need to add random charicters to the answer ID's
#Make the install proccess significantly easier and more stable. 
#Allow different settings for different sites
##Change what catagorys appear on test (no shuttle questions for non-phoenix sites)
#
#Areas of Focus
#   1 - The testing software should be easy to install and maintain, it should remain usable without me.
#	2 - The Leads need a way to add, remove, and edit questions
#	3 - Employees should be able to verify all answers before final submission
#	4 - The test should be timed, and auto-submit when time runs out.
#	5 - After submitting the results the software should auto grade the test
#	6 - Employees should see the test result as a percentage and a percentage for question categoryâ€™s (Like the CompTIA tests) This would prevent them from knowing the specific questions they got wrong but aid in future studying. 
#	7 - Leads should be able to review specific answers to all questions
#	8 - Techs can flag questions they think need improvement while taking the test, for leads to review
#	9 - Leads should be able to remove poorly worded questions (from taken tests) and have the test automatically re-score.
#   10 - The results should be saved and easily retrievable at a later date by management for anyone who has taken the test.
