#FIXES TO IMPLEMENT FOR BETA BUILD
#Change from 8 answeres to any number of answeres
#Add config page with the following values for leads to change
###How long techs have to enter their UID
###How long techs have to take the test
###Change what percentage constitutes a passing score (change the color shown for grades)
###Text feild leads can use for L2 Test explanation on front page.
###How many questions are on the test.
###Allow different settings for different sites
#####Change what catagorys appear on test (no shuttle questions for non-phoenix sites)
#Stop techs from being able to refresh for a different test.
#
#TODO list for Alpha build
#Add bulk import tool to test edit page
#Make password reset page
#Make install easier and configurabe
##Installer chooses admin login + Password
##Installer chooses DB password
#
#Areas of Focus
#   1 - The testing software should be easy to install and maintain, it should remain usable without me.
#	2 - The Leads need a way to add, remove, and edit questions
#	3 - Employees should be able to verify all answers before final submission
#	4 - The test should be timed, and auto-submit when time runs out.
#	5 - After submitting the results the software should auto grade the test
#	6 - Employees should see the test result as a percentage and a percentage for question categoryâ€™s (Like the CompTIA tests) This would prevent them from knowing the specific questions they got wrong but aid in future studying. 
#	7 - Leads should be able to review specific answers to all questions
#	8 - Techs can flag questions they think need improvement while taking the test, for leads to review
#	9 - Leads should be able to remove poorly worded questions (from taken tests) and have the test automatically re-score.
#   10 - The results should be saved and easily retrievable at a later date by management for anyone who has taken the test.

#   10/29/2016 - When a new tech is added to the login database all entries over 120 days old get purged to keep the database runing smothly. This is ok since that DB only actualy needs to hold the entry for a few hours.

#   06/18/2016 - Decided not to use any API's as they can change, making this program unusable. That would be contrary to AOF 1. This means I cannot use the API's for jomax login. 
#   06/18/2016 - If I can make it run in Apache 2.2 then it will run with the label printer P3DCAPP/L2Test
